Git Subtrees allow easily tracking and contributing to remote repositories.  The advantage over submodules is that the tracked subdirectory is contained within the current repository repository history so no initialization and update cycle is required when cloning the project.  Additionally, the history of the subtree may be fully tracked or squashed.

# track a remote repository, squash commits

1. add subtree as a remote

    `git remote add -f $REMOTE_NAME $REMOTE_URI`

2. setup remote as a subtree with a relative local path.  this will fetch and merge.

    `git subtree add --prefix $LOCAL_PATH $REMOTE_NAME $REMOTE_BRANCH --squash`

3. fetch and merge (pull) when the subtree remote has updates

    ```git fetch $REMOTE_NAME $REMOTE_BRANCH
    git subtree pull --prefix $LOCAL_PATH $REMOTE_NAME $REMOTE_BRANCH
    ```

# track a subdirectory of a remote repository, keep full history

1. clone remote repository as a new project

    `git clone $REMOTE_URI`

2. discard everything but the subdirectory wanted, this will make the wanted directory the project root with full working history.

    ```cd $CLONED_REPO
    git checkout -b $WORK_BRANCH
    git filter-branch --subdirectory-filter $WANTED_DIRECTORY HEAD -- --all
    git reset --hard
    git gc --aggressive
    git prune
    ```

3. setup new remote to contain project, and push to master branch at that location

    ```git remote add $NEW_REMOTE_NAME $NEW_REMOTE_URI
    git push --set-upstream $NEW_REMOTE_NAME $WORK_BRANCH:master
    ```

4. use that new repository as a subtree in either project to commit changes to both repositories.  if you'd like the full history in your project, leave off the `--squash` during submodule commands.
