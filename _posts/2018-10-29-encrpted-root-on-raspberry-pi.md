For a long time I have wanted to setup a Raspberry Pi to use as a development
machine. The first attempts I made a few years ago were not successful using a
Raspberry Pi B (the machine was barely able to run chromium, much less an `npm
watch` command and a web inspector). But these days, a Raspberry Pi 3+ is
serviceable as a daily use development machine.

Another huge consideration for using a Raspberry Pi as a "daily driver" is that
the security of having unencrypted root and boot partitions on an easily removed
sd card is "less than acceptable" since anyone with physical access to the Pi
can modify your os and filesystem. Essentially, if the sd card is stolen, an
attacker will have access to all files on it.

I don't believe the Raspberry Pi is capable of having an encrypted boot
partition or signed kernel at this point, which does not mitigate against evil
maid attacks with kernel modifications, but it is possible to encrypt the root
filesystem so that the system is encrypted at rest and if the sd card is lost or
stolen, your data *should* be safe.

Another exciting feature of the Raspberry Pi 3's is that they allow [booting
from
usb](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/bootmodes/msd.md),
so one simple way of mitigating the chances of an evil maid attack is to keep a
usb drive on a keychain, so any attacker will need to get ahold of the usb drive
to perform an evil maid attack.

***Please note that the following instructions of encrypting a usb storage
device will not protect from evil maid attacks. If the usb device leaves the
posession of the owner, it should be considered tainted, and should never be
used to boot again (though encrypted data in the root partition may still be
considered secure).***

# Instructions

*Compiled from the [arch linux arm install instructions] and the [arch linux arm
cryptsetup instructions]*

To begin with, the usb drive should be prepared on a running linux installation.

## Figure out the device name using `lsblk`

Use `lsblk` to find the usb drive, and make sure you find the right device; for
the following instructions we are using `/dev/sdX`, and I hope that is not an
actual device on your system.

## Format `/dev/sdX` with fdisk

```
fdisk /dev/sdX
```

At the fdisk prompt, delete old partitions and create a new one:

1. Type `o`. This will clear out any partitions on the drive.
1. Type `p` to list partitions. There should be no partitions left.
1. Type `n`, then `p` for primary, `1` for the first partition on the drive,
   press `ENTER` to accept the default first sector, then type `+512M` for the
   last sector.
1. Type `t`, then `c` to set the first partition to type W95 FAT32 (LBA).
1. Type `n`, then `p` for primary, `2` for the second partition on the drive,
   and then press `ENTER` twice to accept the default first and last sector.
1. Write the partition table and exit by typing `w.


## Create the FAT filesystem for the boot volume:

```
mkfs.vfat /dev/sdX1
```


## Create the encrypted ext4 filesystem for the root volume

```
cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/sdX2

WARNING!
========
This will overwrite data on /dev/sdX2 irrevocably.

Are you sure? (Type uppercase yes): YES
Enter passphrase: 
Verify passphrase: 
```

## Open a decrypted block device

```
cryptsetup open /dev/sdX2 pi-root
```

## Create an ext4 filesystem on the encrypted block device

```
mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/pi-root
```

## Mount the root (`/`) and `/boot` filesystems in `/mnt`

```
mount /dev/mapper/pi-root /mnt
mkdir -p /mnt/boot
mount /dev/sdX1 /mnt/boot
```

## Download and extract the distribution image over `/mnt`

```
wget http://os.archlinuxarm.org/os/ArchLinuxARM-rpi-2-latest.tar.gz
bsdtar -xpf ArchLinuxARM-rpi-2-latest.tar.gz -C /mnt
sync
```

_Despite `bsdtar` complaining about `Failed to set file flags` in `./boot/*`,
the operation was successful._

## Chroot into `/mnt` with `qemu`

***Note: the following steps should be done in the qemu chroot!***

***This is a badass way to manage a Pi system; you can just insert the usb into
a host system and boot into it as if you're physically using a Pi***

```
cd /mnt
systemd-nspawn --bind /usr/bin/qemu-arm-static -b -D /mnt

# exit when finished with 'poweroff'
```

### Administer system

#### Update `/etc/resolv.conf`

```
rm /etc/resolv.conf
echo "nameserver 8.8.8.8" > /etc/resolv.conf ## Not sure about this one, it worked for me
```

#### Update arch

```
pacman-key --init
pacman-key --populate archlinuxarm
pacman -Suy
```

#### Add encrypted root dependencies

```
pacman -S lvm2 cryptsetup
```



#### Setup kernel for mkinitcpio to use encrypted lvm2

##### Add `lvm2` and `encrypt` to `HOOKS` in `/etc/mkinitcpio.conf`

```
HOOKS="base udev autodetect modconf block lvm2 encrypt filesystems keyboard fsck"
```

##### Generate a new kernel

```
pacman -S linux
```

#### setup Pi `/boot/cmdline.txt` to use the encrypted device

Add: `root=/dev/mapper/usb-drive cryptdevice=/dev/sda2:usb-drive
rootfstype=ext4` to the command

#### Setup `/etc/fstab` to point to the usb drive instead of the sd card

```
# <file system> <dir> <type> <options> <dump> <pass>
/dev/sda1  /boot   vfat    defaults        0       0
```

### Poweroff the chroot and unmount the SD card

```
poweroff
umount /mnt/boot
umount /mnt
sync
```

## Boot the Raspberry Pi

Remove the sd card from the raspberry pi, plug in the usb drive and a usb
keyboard, and power it on.
