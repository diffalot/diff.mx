i've been enjoying watching [__sword art
online__](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sword_Art_Online) lately.  the first
half of the first season was a lightly entertaining jaunt into full emersion virtual reality
(full body neurological haptic control) with a evil mad scientist serial killer
bad guy, but the second half of that first season was atrocious in it's use of [the damsel in distress trope](http://www.feministfrequency.com/tag/damsel-in-distress/).

being a little bored tonight, tired of television (hence the renewed interest in anime), and unable to find anything new that could catch my interest, i thought, "what the hell, i'll see if the second season continues the bad or brings back the good elements of the first season."  and was i pleasantly surprised: yes.

not only does season two abandon the damsel in distress shenanigans, but the new hero we meet is a young girl gamer who is no damsel in distress, but also uses video games to overcome bullying and ptsd.

this is great stuff.  i dig it.  if only gaming culture could catch up...
