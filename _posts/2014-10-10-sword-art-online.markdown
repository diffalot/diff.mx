i've been enjoying watching [_sword art
online_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sword_Art_Online) lately [(it's on
crunchroll right now)](http://www.crunchyroll.com/sword-art-online).  the first
half of the first season was a lightly entertaining jaunt into full emersion
virtual reality (full body neurological haptic control) with a evil mad
scientist serial killer bad guy, but the second half of that first season was
atrocious in it's use of [the damsel in distress
trope](http://www.feministfrequency.com/tag/damsel-in-distress/).

being a little bored tonight, tired of american and british television (hence
the renewed interest in anime), and unable to find anything new that could
catch my interest, i thought, "what the hell, i'll see if the second season
continues the bad or brings back the good elements of the first season."  and
was i pleasantly surprised: yes.

not only does season two abandon the damsel in distress shenanigans, but the
new hero we meet is a young girl gamer who is no damsel in distress, but also
uses video games to overcome bullying and severe ptsd.

this is great stuff.  i dig it.  if only gaming culture could catch up...
