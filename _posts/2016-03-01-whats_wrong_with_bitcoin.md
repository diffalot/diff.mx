Bitcoin will never be useful for anything except modeling economies.  The
network is just an ever growing random hash, constantly becoming larger and
more complex, and this is not the way any real economy works.  Real economies
are _lossy_: resources are destroyed, resources are found, money goes missing,
catastrophies happen, black markets flourish, and data is lost, but Bitcoin is
forever.
