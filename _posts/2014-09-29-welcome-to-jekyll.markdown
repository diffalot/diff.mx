A number of methods exist to 'harden' mailto links against harvesting. However, these methods are not guaranteed to remain effective if the technology of harvesting robots is improved. Form based alternatives however, experience similar challenges with preventing spam,[6] which has led to the introduction of CAPTCHAs, 'humanity checks' and other anti-spam measures.

Additionally, if no email client or webmail service has been explicitly established to act as the default, one may still exist if an email client was pre-installed by the computer vendor but never used or configured by the user. In this case, upon clicking a mailto link, the user will be subjected to a volley of technical questions by the unconfigured email client.

The mailto URI scheme, as registered with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), defines the scheme for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) email addresses. It allows users clicking a link in a website to send an e-mail without first having to copy the destination e-mail address and open an e-mail client. Though its use is not strictly defined, URLs of this form are intended to be used to open the new message window of the user's email client when the URL is activated, with the address as defined by the URL in the "To:" field.
