i'm starting over with blogging.  i don't know what i'm going to write about, i
don't know how often i'm going to write, but i feel i've reached a place where
i'm not terrified of stating my opinions on  ... things.

i'm going to take it slowly.  i'm not going to worry about spelling or
punctuation.  i'm not going to worry too much about what i say.  (of course
i'll be avoiding saying mean things, but i've reached a point where i don't
mind saying something factually wrong or theoretically idiotic&mdash;i can
finally view my lack of perfection as part of the process.)

things i know my blog needs:

1. tags, categories, and search &mdash; this is my offboard brain, i need to be
   able to find things in it
2. compiled list of offsite links &mdash; further handy reference material
3. __this is a biggie that will be tough to develop__ some way to aggregate all
   the things i favorite across social platforms: my feed reader, twitter,
youtube &mdash; i want to be able to search through media that i've liked and
quickly access it or share it
